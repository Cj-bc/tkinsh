  overwride `tput` command and make it easier to make UI in CLI.

# How to use this

  I think I might make a good library management tool for bash someday, but I'm not sure when I'll make it...

  ## Using homebrew

  1. `brew tap Cj-bc/tkinsh` and `brew install tkinsh`
  2. add "source <tkinsh_path(default--/usr/local/lib/tkinsh/tkinsh.sh)>" at the top of your sourcecode

  Don't forget to make users install tkinsh with your project if you release them.

  ## include all into your project (recomended)

  1. at your project directory, `git pull https://github.com/Cj-bc/tkinsh.git`
  2. `./tkinsh/projinstall.sh`
